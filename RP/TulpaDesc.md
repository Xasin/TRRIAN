First of all, it is helpful to mention that all three system-members are dragon of similar "species", so to say:
Their size is roughly human-sized, with a shoulder height of ~1.2m
Their bodies are covered in a thick fur which seems built similarily to an avian's feathers: A slightly more wind-proof layer on the outside, while the inside is softer, and puffy.
The wings are covered in normal, long feathers.

One speciality of this type of dragon is its bioluminescence: On each of the three one can spot variously shaped and colored markings of a faintly glowing fur.
Their eyes, tongue, etc. also possess a similar glow. The intensity varies slightly based on mood; however it can be "flashed" as defence, or blacked out completely if necessary.

#### Xasin

Xasin, the host of the system, is a red-furred male dragon, with a white underbelly. 
Down from between his two straight horns a broad, cyan-colored luminescent stripe runs right up to the tip of his tail; other body regions feature a similar luminescent glow.
Additionally to this, black, separating lines run between the red and white regions.

#### Neira

Neira is the oldest tulpa of the system. She was planned and forced for three months, starting from the 26.08.13, before reaching vocality.
Personality-wise she is the calmest, enjoying herself a bit more on logical, calm challenges of the mind.
Her color scheme is a bit simpler than Xasin's: A deep, navy-blue fur coats her back and top of the wings, while her belly and rest is of clear white color.
Her luminescent color is a contrasting orange, with various, "thrown-about" patches lining her back and tail. 
Incidentally, one of those patches runs over her right eye, leaving it blue-glowing, and not orange, and making her eyes heterochromial.

#### Mesh

Mesh can be called the most active of the three. She was never 100% intentionally forced, but her "design" had been present for years before even Neira!
Her official date of vocality is the 15.01.14, on which she just .. Popped up, mostly.
Her physiology is also the most curious of three, with a bit more detail than meets the eyes at first glace~
Her body is completely covered in a shiny, grassy-green fur, broken only by her magenta/purple luminescent eyes, as well as two similarily-colored stripes running down from between her horns up to the tip of her tail!
